`Yo! Check out this codebase and create a **TOKE.md** file with:

- Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
- Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

This file's gonna help other AI coding buddies (like yourself) work on this repo. Keep it around 20-30 lines, nice and chill.
If there's already a **TOKE.md**, make it even better.

If there are Cursor rules (in `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules`) or Copilot rules (in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`), definitely include them.
Add the `.toke` directory to the `.gitignore` file if it's not already there.
