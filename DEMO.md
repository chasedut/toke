- Industry-specific knowledge baked in

### Future Vision:
- Weedmaps API templates built-in
- Strain recommendation algorithms
- Compliance checking for different states
- Integration with lab testing APIs
- Budtender training mode

## Closing (30 seconds)
"Toke isn't just another AI assistant - it's YOUR assistant, built for the weed industry. It speaks our language, understands our challenges, and makes coding as enjoyable as a good sesh.

```

### B. Delivery Route Optimization
```
> Build me a delivery route optimizer for cannabis deliveries with:
  - Time windows for each stop
  - Product verification at each stop
  - Driver safety features
```

### C. Lab Test Parser
```
> Parse this lab test PDF and extract THC, CBD, and terpene profiles
```

## Q&A Prep

**Q: How is this different from GitHub Copilot or Cursor?**
A: Those are generic tools. Toke understands weed industry specifics - compliance, lab tests, inventory tracking, etc. Plus, the vibe is completely different.

**Q: Can it help with compliance?**
A: Yes! Future versions will include state-specific compliance checking.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: It's a hackathon project showing the potential. With Weedmaps support, we could make this the industry standard.

**Q: Why the weed culture theme?**
A: Authenticity matters. This is BY our community FOR our community. No corporate sanitization.

## Technical Setup Notes
- Ensure API keys are set (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Have backup slides showing the code changes
- Test internet connection for API calls
- Have local demo data ready as backup

## Remember:
- Keep energy HIGH 🚀
- Show genuine excitement about the project
- Emphasize Weedmaps integration potential
- Have fun with it! This is supposed to be enjoyable

Good luck! You got this! 💚🍃
